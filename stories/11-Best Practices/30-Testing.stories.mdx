# Testing Best Practices

Product, Design, and Engineering need a way to answer hypotheses, empathize with users, and save Engineering time spent iterating. Of those listed, you can account for all when factoring a Testing Strategy into projects. The Digital team strives to be a data-driven, user-centric team that integrates testing & research into our product design and development process.

We support usability testing best practices before any implementation of platform iteration and/or innovation. These methods allow for efficient evaluation of design hypothesis and/or identification of opportunities for improvements to inform solutions that will be additive to the user experience (and at the same time, do business goals).

### Testing Guidelines

* **If you have a question, run a test.** Self explanatory.

* **Create research tickets.** Research is time intensive. Understand that research can take various forms of fidelity (ex. Guerrilla, vs Formal). Try to account for an appropriate amount of time needed to complete your project.

* **Make a Research Test Plan.** Document Objectives / Goals, Hypotheses, Timelines, Target audiences, Screener Questions, and Methodologies in a central place. This will help explain the reasoning behind your research.  

* **Write a Report.** One of the best ways of summarizing and sharing data is by creating a report! Append this to the end of your Test Plan, or create a presentation deck for sharing with  stakeholders. The report can also list out recommendations of opportunities to explore, or areas of improvement. 

* **Include Stakeholders in your research efforts.** Including stakeholders as part of your research process will broaden your perspectives. Including others also fosters understanding towards potential impacts or discoveries along the way. If stakeholders are not able to take part: add snippets of recordings, or quotes from users to convey pain points in your final report. 

* **Make Research a part of the beginning, middle, and end of every project.** Make time to make sure research impacts every decision that you make in a project. By testing, we can help the team avoid conflict, spin, and indecision when working together. (ex. Put together a pitch? Run an interview! Finalizing wireframes? Run a card-sort or tree test! Finalizing design direction? Preference test could be your BFF! Want to make sure the product works the way the team intended? Run a usability test! ... and so on...)
