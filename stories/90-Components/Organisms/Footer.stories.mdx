# Footers

Footers live at the bottom of every webpage and contain the global navigation, brand and legal information, secondary links, CTAs, and smaller molecules. These page components are important for navigation, giving users a clear list of options when they reach the bottom of the page.

  

## What’s Inside
Radial’s default footer includes placeholders for branding, a brief description, primary/secondary navigation, and social links. It also contains two areas for additional components to be dropped in as needed. 

At a minimum, a footer should contain top-level navigational links in parity with the Site Header. A footer should also always include branding of the respective brand in the "Brand Placeholder" area.

1- **Brand Placeholder** - Placeholder for logo of respective brand. This is required.

2- **Property Description** - Short description of the site and/or brand/organization. This is required.

3- **Primary Navigation** - Top-level links to inner site pages or important areas of the site. Also called "Global Navigation." Use this area for required site links such as About or Sponsorship before using the Secondary Navigation. This is required. 

4- **Vertical Component Area** - Flexible area for interactive components, such as buttons or form fields, can be optionally included in the footer depending on site goals. This is optional.

5- **Copyright Text, Attribution, and Legal Links** - Placeholder area for copyright and legal links (ex: © 2020 New York Public Radio). This is required and will flex to include links to required broadcast policies when applicable.

6- **NYPR Brand Roll** - Standardized copy and list with links to all NYPR properties; a requirement for Comscore audience counting. This is required.

7- **Horizontal Component Area** - Another flexible area for custom components to be dropped in as needed. (ex: Sign Up Form, Search, Donate Button, etc). This is optional.

8- **Social Links** - Link off to a brand's social media accounts. This is required.

9- **Secondary Navigation** - Additional links to inner site pages or lower-level areas of the site as needed, includes optional subheaders. This area can be used as a traditional sitemap, or to expose underlying topics or offerings which are not obvious at the global-navigation level. This is optional.



  ## Legal Requirements
  
As well as holding links and information, footers are a designated area for legal information such as  copyright, attribution, and terms of use links. The items below are **REQUIRED** to be in a footer, with some items specific to broadcasting.

### Copyright text

 ## Configurations

Much like our other larger organisms, sections of the footer component can be turned on and off to suit the needs of a brand. Two areas for additional components provide further flexibility. Below are some examples of footer configurations done by toggling molecules off and on.

<img alt="footer1 config" src="./images/Organisms-Footer -Desktop1.png" width="500" />
&nbsp;
<img alt="footer3 config" src="./images/Organisms-Footer - Desktop-3.png" width="500" />
&nbsp;
<img alt="footer2 config" src="./images/Organisms-Footer -Desktop-2.png" width="500" />
&nbsp;

  ## Responsive Sizing

While the footer is always full-width, sections can condense and stack as the screen size gets narrower. Smaller breakpoints like tablet (1) and mobile (2) are separate components in our Figma library. Note that in mobile, our legal text bumps past other molecules to remain at the bottom of the footer.
