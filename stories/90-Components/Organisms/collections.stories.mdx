# Collections

Our collection component serves as wrapper allows for easy arrangement of other molecules in a vertical or horizontal list format. It also contains an optional title.

## Use Cases

-   Grouping together similar content items like [cards](https://storybook.nypr.digital/latest/index.html?path=/docs/components-molecules-cards--horizontal-small) (i.e. a list of articles, a selection of podcast episodes)     
-   Enclosing related UI elements in a cohesive way (i.e. wrapping a text input and some body text to create an email collector)
    
-   **Don't** group unrelated elements together.
    

## What’s Inside

 1- **Background** - An optional background can be used to "visually" put a collection's contents in a container.

2- **Title** - An optional title can give context to the contents of the collection.

3- **Inside Object** - Collections can hold just about anything, but this doesn't mean that they should. Collections are meant to group similar elements or related bits of UI. 

## Variants

### Gothamist - Related Links

A collection can hold a sequence of the same component. In Gothamist, a collection is used to hold a series of small cards to provide “Related Links” to other content. Related Link Collections in Gothamist must have a minimum of 2 objects within them and a maximum of 5. Each object must be of the same type as the others (i.e. all hortizontal card or all vertical cards)


### Gothamist - Recirculation Modules

In the future, collection can also be used to build article recirculation modules in a sustainable way. In the example above, two collections are used to show a list of recent news articles and a featured news story.



## Accessibility
Ensure that the order of the elements in a collection are mirrored by the order they should be logicly read by a screen reader. Left to right for horizontal lists. Top to bottom for vertical. 

## Testing and Iterations
Any updates/progress to this component can be listed out here. Maybe eventually this will be automated.
