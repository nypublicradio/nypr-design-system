# Tags

  
Tags are snippets of text used to label or categorize content. Content that is associated with a tag may display the tag for the purposes of understanding what the content is about or for navigating to similar content. They're primarily utilized in our design system for articles and editorial content.

  

## Usage

Gothamist.com makes use of "tags" atoms as a way to describe content to a reader. These "tags" are used in a few different places across the site, including as the eyebrow/kicker over a thumbnail in an article card (1), the eyebrow/kicker on an article page (2), and as a way to display story tags at the bottom of an article page (3). Usually, tags are linked as a way to drive users to an aggregation page (tag page) where they can discover additional related content.

## Formatting Best Practices

Tags are most often created by the editorial team, so best practices around length of phrases should be passed on when applicable

-   When writing text for tags, aim for brevity.
    
-   Use title case and capitalize prepositions of four letters or more.
    
-   Avoid phrases longer than three to five words.

In situations of limited horizontal space (eyebrows on a card component, breadcrumbs on mobile) tags more than 25 characters long should be truncated using ellipsis (...) preceding the 25th character.


## Interaction States
Tags have a singular interaction state during hover. By default, on hover, a tags' background color opacity drops 70%, returning to 100% off hover. Easing for this transition is not required.

## Color & Accessibility

The background color of a tag should use a brand primary or accent colors in a way that attracts attention to the object. Both text and background color must meet WCAG 2.0 minimum contrast requirement.
