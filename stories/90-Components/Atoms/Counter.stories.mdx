# Counter

Our counter component is a nifty little widget that includes text, an icon, and an incrementing number value. We use it for counting comments, photos, or any other user-facing numerical value. See it in use inside our Card and Article Metadata components.

  
  

## What’s Inside

1- **Icon** - Optional icon to indicate the thing you’re counting (Note: You must include either an icon, text, or both to give context to the value being counted. Don’t leave that number standing out by its lonesome)


2- **Value** - The numerical value of whatever is being counted.

 
3- **Text** - Placeholder for text describing the thing you’re counting. 1-2 words maximum. Inherits default link style from parent brand. See note on descriptive requirements above.

  
  

## Configuration

When used, icons should always appear to the left of the value and text to the right of the value. This ensures that visual language always reads correctly left to right.

Note: The icon arrangement rules reflected in this documentation will need to be implemented on Gothamist as the current configuration differs slightly from our new best practices.



## Accessibility

Restated, you must use a descriptive element (text or icon) to describe the value being shown.

Screen readers should be able to read the value and count in a natural order. For example, all the configurations below should read as, "32 Photos."
