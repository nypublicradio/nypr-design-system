# Color

<ColorSwatch />


Colors in Radial play double duty. They should be expressive of the brand and purposeful in usage. Like Daniel Craig as Bond, colors should look incredible on screen, but also deftly complete the mission.


### Categories

Colors can be thought of in three distinct categories. Primary colors include core brand colors (i.e. WNYC red) and can be used for prominent page elements such as CTAs, buttons, and backgrounds. Utility colors are typically shades of black and white used for body text, headers, or default backgrounds. Accent colors are any other polychromatic color used for a functional reason. Accent colors might include a shade of green for success or red for error.

### Accessibility

All text should have enough contrast with its background to be easily readable. Contrast is measured in a ratio format (i.e 4:1) where the difference between the opposing numbers indicates how much luminance there is between a given foreground and background. The bigger the difference between the two numbers, the higher the contrast. According to WCAG 2.0, contrast standards at the AA level are defined:

-   3.0 contrast ratio for large text 
-   14 pt font or larger for bold    
-   18 pt font or larger for regular
-   4.5 contrast ratio for smaller text
    

### Whitelabel Pallete

Our Whitelabel uses a minimal yet functional palette to communicate best practices of Primary, Utility, and Accent colors.

WHITELABEL COLOR SWATCHES  (PRIMARY / UTILITY / ACCENT)

**Cool Blue** is the primary color for CTAs, buttons, or interactive elements. **Ceramic Blue** can be used as a header color or background color for larger, prominent components. **Sky Blue** is purely a decorative lighter alternative. **Gray Dark** is our primary text color, including headers, body text, and small text. **Cool White** is an alternative background-color. **Ember Red** is used solely for errors or warnings and **Sea Green** for success messaging or confirmations.

### Gothamist Palette

Our no-nonsense civic-minded palette for Gothamist focuses on text content and headlines while accenting with color that reminds us of the warm asphalt jungle that is NYC.

GOTHAMIST COLOR SWATCHES (PRIMARY / UTILITY / ACCENT)


**Banana Yellow** is the primary color used for accents, emphasis, and CTAs. **Reddish Orange** is also used for CTAs and actions related to donating or membership. **WNYC Red** is self-explanatory. **Gray Dark** is the primary header and body text color. **Gray** is used for certain icons, and **Dirty Salmon** is used for header underlines and emphasis. **Dusk Blue** is used for important banners, Purple for things relating to sponsored content, and **Taxicab Yellow** for highlighted container backgrounds (banners, signup cards, etc.)
