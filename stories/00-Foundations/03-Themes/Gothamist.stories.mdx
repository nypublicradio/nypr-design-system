# Gothamist

## Branding
![enter image description here](https://via.placeholder.com/150)

The Gothamist logo features both a horizational and vertical variant. Use the vertical variant when you've got height to spare and something to say, and use the horizontal variant in more compact spaces.

## Typography
Gothamist uses three typefaces for its brand, creating a clear and expressive hierarchy while maintaining readability. These typefaces complement each other, while also performing well in their assigned hierarchy. Pragati Narrow is used as the primary font for headlines and titles. Barlow is used as a secondary font for body text. B612 Mono is used as a tertiary font for small headers and info text.

## Color Pallete
Our no-nonsense civic-minded palette for Gothamist focuses on text content and headlines while accenting with color that reminds us of the warm asphalt jungle 
that is NYC.
