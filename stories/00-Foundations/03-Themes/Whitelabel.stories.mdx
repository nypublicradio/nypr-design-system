# Whitelabel (Default)

## Branding

Our default whitelabel theme has no inherit branding as it is meant to serve as the baseline for all other themes.

## Typography
Our Whitelabel uses two typefaces to show clear hierarchy and to display style variation/font flexibility within a given theme. Libre Baskerville is used as our default primary font for headlines and titles. Source Sans Pro is used as our default secondary and tertiary font for body text as well as small headers and info text

## Color Pallete
Our Whitelabel uses a minimal yet functional palette to communicate best practices of Primary, Utility, and Accent colors.
