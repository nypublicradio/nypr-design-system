# Themes

Themes live in the `/app/styles/themes/` folder. Themes consist of a main theme `scss` file and a folder containing more scss. The main file imports uses scss imports to pull in all of the files from the folder, which just exists as a way to organize the scss.

## Example theme folder layout

| my-new-theme.scss                                      | Main theme file, loads the other files with sass imports
| my-new-theme/_theme.colors.scss                        | The color variables
| my-new-theme/_theme.variables.scss                     | Other Variables
| my-new-theme/_theme.fonts.scss                         | Font Importes
